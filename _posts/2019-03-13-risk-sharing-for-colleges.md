# Policymakers hope incentives can turn bad loans into good loans

The White House is considering forcing universities to pay for part of the losses on student loan defaults. This would incentivize colleges to get students good jobs, reduce default rates for borrowers, and boost the rate of return on the loans for the government.

While this seems like a winning solution, it's worth thinking about what caused the problem. The federal government made risky loans to bad borrowers, and does not like the high default rates. Defaults hurt borrowers and lenders, who both lose money. Now the government wants universities to fix the problem by providing well-paying jobs to even marginal students. This would turn risky loans into good ones, and students would avoid painful defaults.

Indeed, providing good jobs for _all_ students would solve many problems, but it is unrealistic. Universities already try hard to get students to graduate and secure good jobs, yet many students continue to fail out. Despite the big pay bump from earning the diploma, many students cannot graduate. It's hard to think there is much slack to get more students to cross the finish line without lowering standards.

IRegardless, if universities must share the bill for default, and cannot get more students good jobs, they will likely restrict access to low-ability students. They would raise the price to compensate for the higher default risk. Or, if they are unprofitable, not admit them at all. Restricting access for bad students is not what the government is hoping for, and they would likely be disappointed with the result.

While expanding opportunity is good, freely lending to risky borrowers seems reckless. Many poor students will predictably fail and be saddled with large debts they cannot repay. Giving risky students loans to marginal borrowers hardly seems like a charitable act.

It would be more prudent to offer loans only to students who are likely to repay, and couldn't afford it otherwise. For these talented, but poor, students the loan will likely pay off for both parties. But for untalented students, a loan would likely cause heartache. Even though it looks bad politically, more judicious lending would avoid giving students debt they won't be able to afford, saves money for taxpayers, and still give opportunities to talented students.
