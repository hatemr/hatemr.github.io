# Policymakers hope incentives can turn bad loans into good loans

The White House is [considering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-might-put-colleges-on-the-hook-for-student-loans-11552406110?mod=e2fb&fbclid=IwAR1knGWkLnUNmqVkQUofMJq7Seylq-z07inOdEcZsPCRVroRQk6Ho_08Bjk) giving universities responsibility to pay for part of the losses on student loan defaults. This would incentivize colleges to get students good jobs, hopefully reduce default rates for borrowers, and boost the rate of return on the loans for the government.

While getting better jobs for students is a worthwhile goal, there is little reason to think the new incentives would help. Universities already try hard to get students to graduate and secure good jobs, yet many students continue to fail out. Despite the big pay bump from earning the diploma, many students cannot graduate. It's hard to think there is much slack to get more students to cross the finish line without lowering standards.

Moreover, asking universities to help cover risks the government took on by making risking loans seems unfair. The government made the bad loans; they should bear the risks. It is true that colleges have benefitted from loose loan financing, but if the government doesn't think the loans are being spent wisely they could add conditions to the loan; lend only to students who are likely to graduate. If students, and their lenders, prefered more practical degrees then universities would offer them (they already do; look at the new data science masters degrees and other STEM degrees designed to meet demand from foreigners who want work visas).

Instead, forcing the universities to pay some of the default losses effectively dumps the task of assessing creditworthiness to the universities. Universities would raise prices for students who are less likely to repay their loans, or deny them outright if they are highly unlikely to repay. However, this offers a large benefit for politicians; assessing creditworthiness and denying applicants is unpopular and shifting it to universities takes it off their hands.

On the other hand, it seems fair to ask universities to help with the social mission of giving opportunities to students, if they receive federal funding. But this is a roundabout way of doing it, and it unfairly gives colleges the unpopular task of enforcing prudent lending standards. Moreover, excessively free lending hurts many of the people it's supposed to help; students. Many poor students will predictably fail and be saddled with large debts they cannot repay. Giving risky loans to marginal borrowers hardly seems like a charitable act.

It would be more prudent for governemnt to restrict loans only to students who are likely to repay and couldn't afford it otherwise. For talented but poor students, the loan will likely pay off for both parties. But for untalented students, a loan would probably cause heartache. Even though it looks bad politically, more judicious lending would avoid giving students debt they won't be able to afford, save money for taxpayers, and still give opportunities to talented students who need it.
