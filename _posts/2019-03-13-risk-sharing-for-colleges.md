# Policymakers hope incentives can turn bad loans into good loans

The White House is considering forcing universities to pay for part of the losses on student loan defaults. This incentivizes colleges to get students good jobs, reduces default rates for borrowers, and boosts the rate of return on the loans for the government.

While this seems like a winning solution, it's worth thinking about what caused the problem. The federal government made risky loans to bad borrowers, and does not like the high default rates. Defaults hurt borrowers and lenders, who both lose money. Now the government wants universities to fix the problem. If universities can provide even marginal students well-paying jobs, then the risky loans will act like good loans, and students will avoid painful defaults.

Indeed, providing good jobs for \textit{all} students would solve many problems, but it is unrealistic. Universities already try hard to get students to graduate and secure good jobs, yet many students continue to fail out. Despite the big pay bump from earning the diploma, many students cannot graduate. It's hard to think there is much slack to get more students to graduate, without lowering standards.

Moreover, even if every student could graduate, it would not lead to good jobs for all. It would cause credential inflation; employers ratchet up the requirements to be considered for any given job. We've already seen large credential inflation. From 1975 to 1995, an extra 1.2 years of schooling was needed to be considered for a list of 500 occupations that hadn't changed much over that span. Graduating college used to be an impressive accomplishment; now there are so many college graduates that it's not that impressive. Employers expect more now. When you also consider how little of school teaches useful jobs skills, it's hard to argue that more college graduates is a good for society.

Regardless, if universities must share the bill for default, and cannot get more students good jobs, they will likely restrict access to low-ability students. They would raise the price for low-ability students to compensate for the higher default risk. Or, if they are unprofitable, not admit them at all. Restricting access for bad students is not what the government is hoping for, and they would likely be disappointed with the result.

While expanding opportunity is good, freely lending to risky borrowers seems reckless. Many poor students will predictably fail and be saddled with large debts they cannot repay. Giving risky students loans to marginal borrowers hardly seems like a charitable act.

It would be more prudent to offer loans only to students who are likely to repay, and couldn't afford it otherwise. For these talented, but poor, students the loan will likely pay off for both parties. But for untalented students, a loan would likely cause heartache. Even though it looks bad politically, more judicious lending would avoid giving students debt they won't be able to afford, saves money for taxpayers, and still give opportunities to talented students.
