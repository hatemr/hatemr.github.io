# Policymakers hope incentives can turn bad loans into good loans

The White House is [considering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-might-put-colleges-on-the-hook-for-student-loans-11552406110?mod=e2fb&fbclid=IwAR1knGWkLnUNmqVkQUofMJq7Seylq-z07inOdEcZsPCRVroRQk6Ho_08Bjk) giving universities responsibility to pay for part of the losses on student loan defaults. This would incentivize colleges to get students good jobs, hopefully reduce default rates for borrowers, and boost the rate of return on the loans for the government.

While getting better jobs for students is a worthwhile goal, there is little reason to think the new incentives would help. Universities already try hard to get students to graduate and secure good jobs, yet many students continue to fail out. Despite the big pay bump from earning the diploma, many students cannot graduate. It's hard to think there is much slack to get more students to cross the finish line without lowering standards.

Moreover, asking universities to help cover risks the government took on by making risking loans seems unfair. The government made the bad loans; they should bear the risks. It is true that colleges have benefitted from loose loan financing, but if the government doesn't think the loans are being spent wisely they could add conditions to the loan. For example, lend only to students who are likely to graduate, or study a practical major. Offering loans loosely then asking universities to help cover the loses seems like a roundabout way of getting good loan outcomes.

If universities were forced to pay for part of default losses, they would probably restrict access to low-ability students. Or charge them higher prices to compensate for the higher default risk. This would effectively shift the task of assessing creditworthiness to the universities. This seems especially unfair to universities because assessing creditworthiness and denying applicants is unpopular; it looks mean. The government would be getting the unpopular task off their hands.

Moreover, regardless of who is paying for it, offering loose loans actually _hurts_ many of the people its designed to help. Many bad students will predictably fail and be saddled with large debts they cannot repay. It both costs a lot of money _and_ hurts people. Hardly a charitable act.

It would be more prudent for governemnt to offer loans only to students who are likely to repay and couldn't afford it otherwise. For talented but poor students, the loan will likely pay off for both parties. For untalented students, a loan would probably cause heartache. Even though it sounds bad politically, more judicious lending would avoid giving students debt they won't be able to afford, save money for taxpayers, and still give opportunities to talented students who need it.
