Residents are very excited about the new Jewel Osco grocery store in Woodlawn. There aren't many grocery stores around, especially with Treasure Island closing a few months ago. People are, apparently, yearning for more options. Yet Jewel Osco used some money from a \$30.5 million federal grant to pay for it. If consumers wanted this grocery store so badly, why did it take federal money to build it?

* Jewel Osco will be profitable, they just don't see it. We know something about consumer demand that they don't. We need the subsidy just to get the store opened; then they'll see how profitable it is.
  * Seems unlikely that these non-profits can analyze the demand for the store more than Jewel Osco. Jewel Osco has analyzed many possible opening locations and knows how to do it better than a non-profit.
* Jewel Osco did not even consider the Woodlawn location; the subsidy was needed for them to even consider adding a store here. Once they analyzed the area, they found the new store to be worth it.
  * I guess this would be money well spent. However, there are many grocery stores and chains all trying to open profitable stores. It seems unlikely that they would ignore this particular location when considering new locations.
* Jewel Osco has analyzed the demand and thinks a new store is not worth it. Consumers demand is not high enough at competitive prices. Grocery stores are unprofitable here; area residents cannot afford a Jewel Osco so they convinced government and voters to subsidize it for them.
  * It seems unlikely that the store would go along with this plan unless the subsidy was truly big enough to change their minds. Even still, the store could struggle if they overestimated the subsidy's impact. But it would still be good for the community, while it lasts, so the subsidy has some good.
* The store would not be competitive, but we want it to improve the health of area residents by giving them more healthy food options.
  * Again, I doubt a store would go along with such a plan unless the subsidy was truly to big enough. The question remains whether providing the wider selection at Jewel Osco leads to better health. On one hand, people might choose the healthier, yet still palatable options they didn't have before. On the other hand, they might continue choosing unhealthy options (keep in mind that Jewel Osco also has a wider selection of _unhealthy_ options). If the goal was truly healthier eating, it's odd that Jewel Osco offers so much junk food. Moreover, there would be rock solid evidence that wider food selection causes improved health of local residents. The absence of such evidence would suggest either improving health wasn't a motivation, or it was implemented poorly.
* Lenders are racist and don't want to lend money to grocery stores being built in Black neighborhoods. Think red-lining.
  * Seems unlikely before because less-racist lenders would provide the financing and make a profit. It seems unlike that _every_ possible lender is too racist to make this profitable loan; _someone_ would put aside their racism and take the money.  

Number three seems the most likely to me. Non-profits convinced government and voters to pay for a nice grocery store that consumer demand wouldn't provide for otherwise. Despite people's talk about wanting a grocery store, the demand, apparently, wasn't actually there at the right price. Of course, it's possible the store succeeds unexpectedly well after the fact, but this is the only story that makes sense when the decisions were made.

Of course, this is the best explanation I can come up with with the information I have. If anyone has more information, I'd love to hear it.
