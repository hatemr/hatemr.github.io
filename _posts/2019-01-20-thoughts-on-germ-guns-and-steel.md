Many people have recommended **Germs, Guns, and Steel** by Jared Diamond but I forgot about it until a friend recently recommended it again. So I watched the three-part National Geographic series on Youtube based by the book. It was thought provoking and worth the 3 hours (one and half to increase Nat Geo's speed).

The author was talking to a native of Papua New Guinea, near Australia. The native asked "Why you white men have so much cargo and we New Guineans have so little?" Westerners had modern devices and material goods, but New Guineans were farming by hand to survive. Diamond didn't know what to say, so he did some research. Here's what he found.

First, the people who started farming first got ahead because having enough food gave them time to tackle other problems. The people who found farming first did so because they had happened to have high-nutrient vegetation (wheat, barley) to farm and animals that could be domesticatedin their region. Farming started in the Fertile Cresent (Syria, Iraq) and spread across even latitudes to Europe, giving Europeans an advantage. It was geographic luck.

Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, had low-nutrient plants and animals not amenable to domestication (only 11 of the 2000 species in the world have been domesticated; few if any of them are found in Papua New Guinea). PNG stagnated compared to more advanced regions.

Having solved the food problem, Europeans created steel weapons and guns first. This helped Europeans conquor the Americas; the native populations were overmatched when it came to weapons.

Also contributing in the Americas was the diseases (germs) brought by Europeans. Diseases (like smallpox, measles, influenza) decimated the Native American populations, giving Europeans an easier win. These diseases came from domesticated animals; it had ravaged the European population over centuries but the survivors and their descendents were immune already. Getting domesticated animals first gave the Europeans a another big edge.

This explains why some countries could dominate other regions at particular points in time. In short, the army with deadlier weapons wins wars. But it doesn't give much hope for poor countries. Some countries got ahead by luck and stayed ahead; it's hard to see a catch-up plan for the unlucky countries.

It mentions that PNG is modernizing, but quickly, and the rich countries continue to advance so a true catch-up seems unlikely. It's also not clear whether catching up is desirable as long as the poor countries are still moving forward. Why feel bad just because the neighbors have more?
