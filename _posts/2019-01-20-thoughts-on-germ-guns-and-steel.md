I have heard **Germs, Guns, and Steel** by Jared Diamond highly recommended but I forgot about it until a friend recently recommended it. So I watched the three-part National Geographic series on Youtube based by the book. It was thought provoking and worth the 3 hours (one and half to increase Nat Geo's speed).

The author was talking to a native of Papua New Guinea, near Australia. The native asked "Why you white men have so much cargo and we New Guineans have so little?" Westerners had modern devices and material goods, but New Guineans were farming by hand to survive. Diamond didn't know what to say, so he did some research.

First, the people started farming first got ahead because having enough food gave them time to tackle other problems. The people who found farming first did so because they had happened to have high-nutrient vegetation (wheat, barley) to farm and animals that could be domesticated.

Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, had low-nutrient plants and animals not amenable to domestication (only 11 of the 2000 species in the world have been domesticated; none of them are found in Papua New Guinea). Though farming started in the Fertile Cresent (Syria, Iraq), the land there dried up but farming spread across similar latitudes to Europe.

In short, geographic luck casued farming in some regions and not others, and that gave some regions an advantage. Farming solved the food problem, and people had time to work on other problems.

This extra time allowed the leading regions to create guns and steel before others. This gave Europeans huge military advantages over the Native Americans, allowing the Europeans to dominate them.

Also contributing was the diseases (germs) brought by Europeans. Diseases (like smallpox, measles, influenza) decimated the Native American populations, giving Europeans an easier win. These diseases came from domesticated animals; it had ravaged the European population over centuries but the survivors and their descendents were immune already.

Guns, germs, and steel gave advantages to groups who had them over those who did not. These advantages resulted from solving the food problem first. Some regions got ahead by geographic luck, then they stayed ahead.

This explains why some countries could dominate other regions at particular points in time. In short, the army with deadlier weapons wins wars.

The story does not give a path up for poor countries. Lucky regions got ahead and stayed ahead; no mention of poor countries catching up or even surpassing the rich countries. The documentary mentions PNG is modernizing, but slowly, and the rich countries are still advancing, so actually catching up seems unlikely. It's also not clear if "catching up" is important if the poor countries are still moving forward. Why feel bad because the neighbors have more?
