We should do nothing. People already trade off the benefits of healthy food with the enjoyment and convenience of less-healthy alternatives. It is their right to choose for themselves and other people's responsibility to let them choose, even if it hurts us to watch their decisions.

One could argue that people don't have all the information to make an informed decision on diet. They don't realize that sugar or fast food is unhealthy and that's why they continue to choose them. And therefore we should help by informing them.

This makes sense except that health information is widely available on the internet, it's just a Google search away. The diet recommendations they find may not be unanimous, but this probably represents true disagreement in the field. It may also take extra time to research the right diet, but people know how to make tradeoffs with their time. People are able to find the right information if they choose to, so offering education could help but is by no means necessary.

A stronger reason why people choose junk food over healthy food is not ignorance but price; junk food is often less expensive. A simple solution would be to raise the price of junk food via a tax, as they did with cigarettes. People do seem to buy less when the price rises. However, one should also account for the lost purchases that people would have made with that saved money. If people spend more on food, they will have less left over for clothing, school supplies, and healthcare. And these lost purchases are serious consequences that should be considered carefully before imposing a tax.

Indeed, people already choose the the mix of goods and services that they consider to be  best. So imposers of a tax must argue that the taxer should be able to choose what people buy rather than the people themselves. Imposing a tax and changing relative prices effectively takes away people's freedom to choose. And tax imposers should not choose how people spend their money; individuals should choose for themselves.

It is possible that society can justifiably force people to eat healthier since society will pay the healthcare costs. This makes sense, for government-provided healthcare, but I think the solution is to simply not pay for other people's healthcare costs. Then we won't have to pay for the diet mistakes of other people.

Declining to pay for other people's healthcare would also have a positive effect on people's diets  because people would avoid foods that lead to expensive medical conditions. If people have to pay for diabetes treatment, they will try harder to avoid diabetes. 

Still, society will find it painful to watch other people make tradeoffs that we disagree with. But our responsibility is to leave other people alone.
